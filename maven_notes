# Maven

## Maven is a build tool used to build a project

Source code: code written by developers in human readable format

A group of executable file (e.g skpye.exe) packaged together is a software build. 
An exe file holds bit-code files which are group of compiled files
Maven compiles the source code and turns it into human readable format
The outcome of a build tool is an artefact
A build tool not only compiles the source but packages it into a software .

Developers shoudl write both the source code and the build script. 
For Maven, the build script is written in pom.xml. 
The build script should include: dependency, plugins, compiler
Dependecies are source code from ither developers that are incorporated into the software build.
